This is a simple script to convert translations in a Mac .strings file to the equivalent .Net resource file (.resx).

I'm not sure anyone needs this except me, but pre-Transifex it was useful to bulk seed our Windows port with the translations we already had on Mac. Maybe someone doing a similar port will someday find this useful.
